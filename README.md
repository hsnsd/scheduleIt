# scheduleIt

A simple course scheduler using Java, which outputs all possible timetables of the given input course choices, given the general time table.

To manually figure out your timetable is a bit hard, since the course scheduler given by university is convoluted as it is. The program takes input the desired courses, and outputs the possible timetables of the given input courses, from the given schedule.
